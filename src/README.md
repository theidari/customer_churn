<h3>Cutoff Times</h3>
<p align="justify">Cutoff times serve as vital deadlines or specified moments established by businesses, organizations, or service providers to regulate various processes or activities, ensuring that actions or tasks can be concluded within a designated timeframe. They play a pivotal role in fostering consistency, efficiency, and order across diverse operations and transactions. An essential element within the realm of cutoff times is the association of each label with a specific cutoff time. These cutoff times signify the instances at which predictions are formulated and necessitate the availability of all pertinent data for generating features related to that particular label. To illustrate, if the designated cutoff time is January 1 and the objective is to predict churn occurrences during the month of February, all features relevant to this label must be derived from data collected prior to January 1.</p>
